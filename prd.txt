Product Requirements Document (PRD)
1. Overview

Product Name: Quantum Chess

Description:
Quantum Chess is an experimental chess game that integrates quantum computing concepts into traditional chess gameplay. The game uses quantum operations (such as superposition, entanglement, and probabilistic measurement) to determine move outcomes for chess pieces. It combines classical chess logic with quantum mechanics, resulting in unpredictable and dynamic gameplay. The project leverages Python, Qiskit (and Qiskit Aer), and Tkinter for the GUI.

Stakeholders:

    Product Owner: [Your Name or Organization]
    Development Team: Software developers with expertise in quantum computing, UI/UX, and game development.
    End Users: Chess enthusiasts, educators, and users interested in quantum computing concepts.
    Testers: QA team and beta users familiar with both classical and quantum computing paradigms.

2. Purpose and Goals
2.1 Purpose

    To create a unique chess game that demonstrates quantum phenomena like superposition and entanglement.
    To offer an interactive educational tool that introduces quantum mechanics concepts through gameplay.
    To build a modular and extensible codebase that can later integrate additional features (such as advanced quantum moves, multiplayer modes, or further educational content).

2.2 Goals

    Innovation: Integrate quantum operations (e.g., Hadamard for superposition, CNOT for entanglement) into move logic.
    User Engagement: Provide both a command-line and a graphical interface for interacting with the game.
    Modularity: Maintain a clear separation of concerns across modules (game logic, pieces, quantum operations, and GUI) to support future expansion and maintenance.
    Educational Impact: Clearly demonstrate how quantum operations can affect a game state, making quantum computing more accessible.

3. Scope
3.1 In-Scope

    Quantum Mechanics Integration:
        Implementing superposition moves via Hadamard gates.
        Creating entanglement between pieces using CNOT operations.
        Applying quantum measurement to collapse piece states and influence moves.
    Core Chess Gameplay:
        Initializing a full chessboard with 32 quantum chess pieces (each with its corresponding qubit).
        Handling turn-based move execution, including classical moves (with user input) and quantum moves.
        Providing basic game-loop logic and turn switching.
    Graphical User Interface:
        Developing a Tkinter-based chessboard that displays pieces in their current positions.
        Allowing user interaction with the board (click events, piece selection) to trigger moves.
    Quantum Logic Module:
        Managing quantum circuit initialization and manipulation using Qiskit.
        Mapping measurement outcomes to game state updates.

3.2 Out-of-Scope

    Comprehensive classical chess rule enforcement (e.g., full move validation, checkmate conditions).
    Multiplayer or networked play in the initial version.
    Real-time quantum hardware integration (the focus is on simulation using Qiskit Aer).

4. Functional Requirements
4.1 User-Facing Features

    Game Initialization:
        On launch, the game loads a standard chessboard with all 32 pieces assigned to unique qubits.
        The GUI displays an 8×8 board with each square rendered in alternating colors.
    Move Execution:
        Quantum Moves:
            Superposition: Players can apply a Hadamard gate to a piece’s qubit, representing a move into a superposition state.
            Entanglement: Pieces can be entangled with adjacent qubits, linking their states.
            Measurement: Measurement operations collapse a piece’s quantum state, determining its classical outcome.
        Classical Moves:
            Allowing players to manually input a new board position for a piece.
    User Interaction:
        A command-line game loop (in the game module) accepts piece name, target position, and move type.
        The GUI handles mouse click events for board interaction, mapping clicks to board coordinates.
    Feedback:
        Display quantum measurement outcomes in the console.
        Update the board display after moves to reflect changes in piece positions.

4.2 System Features

    Quantum Logic Module:
        Initialize a quantum circuit with 32 qubits.
        Apply gates (Hadamard, CNOT, custom operations) to represent various moves.
        Measure qubits and interpret outcomes using Qiskit’s simulators.
    Game Management Module:
        Maintain game state, turn switching, and basic move validation.
        Integrate quantum moves with classical chess logic.
    GUI Module:
        Render the chessboard and pieces.
        Convert chess notation (e.g., “e2”) to grid coordinates and vice versa.
        Bind click events to board squares to facilitate piece selection and moves.

5. Non-Functional Requirements
5.1 Performance

    Responsiveness:
        The GUI should update in real time after moves.
        Quantum circuit operations and measurements should complete within a reasonable delay (ideally under one second per move).

5.2 Reliability and Accuracy

    Quantum Simulation Consistency:
        The Qiskit simulator must reliably return measurement outcomes that accurately reflect the applied quantum operations.
    Error Handling:
        The game should gracefully handle invalid moves or out-of-bound operations (e.g., attempting to entangle a piece with a non-existent qubit).

5.3 Usability

    User Interface:
        The chessboard and piece labels should be clear and intuitive.
        Provide clear console feedback and instructions for move types.
    Documentation:
        Inline code documentation and a README file should be provided to help new developers and users understand quantum move logic.

5.4 Extensibility

    Modular Code Base:
        Code is split into separate modules (main, game, pieces, quantum_logic, gui) to allow easy future modifications.
    Future Features:
        Design should accommodate additional quantum effects or advanced move validation without major rework.
